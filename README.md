* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0134178943
  * * Author: Bob Blitzer
   
  * Bob Blitzer’s use of realistic applications instantly piques students’ curiosity about the presence of mathematical concepts in the world around them. These applications are apparent throughout the entire program–from his relatable examples, friendly writing style, and thought-provoking features in the textbook, to the enhanced digital resources in the MyMathLab course. Blitzer pulls from topics that are relevant to college students, often from pop culture and everyday life, to ensure that students will actually use their learning resources to achieve success. With an expansion of the series to now include a Developmental Math “all-in-one” text (with content spanning prealgebra through intermediate algebra), and with an enhanced media program accompanying this revision, developmental students at all levels will see how math applies to their daily lives and culture.
